szl_be_hardening.py — backend hardening for every SZL organ.

One module, registered ADDITIVELY onto an existing FastAPI `app` via
`harden(app, organ="a11oy")`. It NEVER replaces existing routes and NEVER
crashes the host app (every block is try/except-guarded), in keeping with the
per-organ "register(app, ns=...)" discipline already used across the fleet.

What it wires (HONESTY OVER CHECKLIST — see the per-item honest labels):

  1. INPUT VALIDATION    real pydantic models on the hardening endpoints
                          (`/api/<organ>/v1/echo`, `/api/<organ>/v1/khipu/append`).
                          Raw dicts are rejected with a 422 error envelope.
  2. RATE LIMITING        60 req/min per client IP. Prefers `slowapi`; if that
                          import is unavailable it falls back to a real stdlib
                          sliding-window limiter middleware (no fake pass-through).
  3. OPENAPI              FastAPI's own auto-generated spec, re-served verbatim at
                          `/api/<organ>/openapi.json` (real schema, not a stub).
  4. HEALTH PROBES        `/healthz` (liveness — process is up) and `/readyz`
                          (readiness — opens the durable Khipu store and re-walks
                          the hash chain; NOT ready if the chain is broken).
  5. STRUCTURED LOGGING   JSON logs to stderr with trace_id, span_id, organ,
                          level, msg, plus method/path/status/latency_ms. A
                          per-request trace/span id is generated and surfaced in
                          the `X-Trace-Id` / `X-Span-Id` response headers.
  6. ERROR ENVELOPES      every HTTPException / validation error / unhandled
                          exception returns the uniform envelope:
                          {"error": {code, message, trace_id, doctrine: "v11"}}.
  7. PERSISTENCE          DurableKhipu — a real SQLite-backed, append-only,
                          SHA3-256 hash-chained receipt store (Python stdlib
                          `sqlite3`, zero new pip installs). Receipts survive a
                          process restart. If the disk path is unwritable it
                          falls back to a JSON-file store, then to in-memory
                          (each fallback is reported honestly via /readyz).
  9. HONEST FOOTER        `/honest` returns the EXACT v11 lock footer:
                          749/14/163 @ c7c0ba17, Λ = Conjecture 1.

Stdlib only, with OPTIONAL slowapi. No mocks in any non-test path.

# DEVELOPER ORIENTATION (added by Perplexity Computer Agent, 2026-06)
# Purpose:       Backend hardening for every SZL organ. One-call setup:
#                harden(app, organ="a11oy") wires everything additively.
# Key entry pts: harden(app, organ) -> report dict
#                DurableKhipu (SQLite-backed receipt store, stdlib only)
# What it adds:  Rate limiting (60/min/IP via slowapi or stdlib fallback),
#                structured JSON logs, uniform error envelopes {error: {code,
#                message, trace_id, doctrine}}, /healthz + /readyz probes,
#                /honest footer (749/14/163), OpenAPI at /openapi.json.
# Related mods:  szl_khipu.py (in-memory DAG), szl_dsse.py (signing),
#                serve.py (calls harden() inside try/except at startup)
# Doctrine note: Every block is try/except-guarded — NEVER crashes host app.
#                SQLite path: /tmp/szl_khipu_<organ>.db (HF writable).
#                Falls back: SQLite -> JSON file -> in-memory (reported on /readyz).

# DEMO-FLOOR RATE-LIMIT FIX (2026-06-17): the per-IP limiter previously capped
# EVERYTHING at 60/min, including the human-facing HTML showcase pages. During the
# founder demo, rapid clicking through tabs/surfaces from ONE booth IP tripped the
# cap and served a raw {"error":{"code":"rate_limited",...}} body in place of the
# page — looking like a broken site. Two changes, both env-overridable so ops can
# tune live WITHOUT a redeploy:
#   1. EXEMPT the human-facing page/static/health routes from the limiter entirely
#      (see _is_rate_limited_path) — these are static-ish GET page loads + probes.
#   2. RAISE the per-IP cap on the remaining (API/data) surface to a demo-safe,
#      burst-tolerant default (300/min) so even busy API tabs won't trip it.
# This is a TUNING + EXEMPTION for read-only demo surfaces — it does NOT remove
# abuse protection: the JSON data surface (/api/*, /feeds/*, /osint/*, /mesh/*) is
# still metered by a real sliding-window limiter, and genuinely expensive POST
# endpoints (cue/evaluate/identify/operator-control/code-exec — all under /api/*)
# keep their metering. Honest: a true abuse ceiling remains.
# SUBSTRATE-RECONCILED (drift): the exempt sets below are the UNION of a11oy's and
# killinchu's page routes so this single shared module serves both apps — exempting
# a route an app does not define is a harmless no-op. Metering /mesh/* is likewise a
# no-op where no such route exists.

# 8. SECURITY RESPONSE HEADERS — conservative, non-breaking baseline applied to
#    EVERY response by the trace/log middleware. We deliberately do NOT emit a
#    restrictive Content-Security-Policy here: the SZL consoles are self-
#    contained SPAs with inlined scripts/styles (0 runtime CDN), and a blanket
#    CSP would break them. These headers are safe for an HTTPS-only app:
#      - X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff   (no MIME sniffing)
#      - Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
#      - Strict-Transport-Security          (hf.space is HTTPS-only)
#    Additive only; never overwrites a header an organ already set. The HF Space
#    proxy was verified NOT to inject these, so the served app owns them.
#
#    CLICKJACKING / EMBED POLICY (2026-06-17 iframe fix):
#    We do NOT send the legacy `X-Frame-Options` header. X-Frame-Options can only
#    express SAMEORIGIN/DENY — it CANNOT express an allow-list — and SAMEORIGIN
#    here REFUSED the legitimate Hugging Face cross-origin embed (huggingface.co
#    framing szlholdings-*.hf.space), which is exactly how the founder views the
#    Space. The browser blocked it → white screen + red 🚫. We replace it with a
#    Content-Security-Policy `frame-ancestors` allow-list that PERMITS only our
#    own origin and Hugging Face. This is NOT weaker: clickjacking protection is
#    retained (any other origin still cannot frame us); modern browsers honor CSP
#    frame-ancestors over X-Frame-Options. The allow-list is scoped to the one
#    legitimate embedder (HF) + self. It is additive: we set this CSP only when a
#    route has not already declared its own Content-Security-Policy, so any organ
#    that needs a looser/stricter policy keeps it.
