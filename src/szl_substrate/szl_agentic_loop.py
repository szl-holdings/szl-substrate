# szl_agentic_loop.py — THE OPERATIONAL GOVERNED AGENT LOOP (additive, sovereign)
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# One module, registered the SAME WAY in a11oy and killinchu, that makes the
# advertised "RAG -> tool-call -> policy/trust gate -> signed receipt" loop
# REAL and CLICKABLE end-to-end, with a per-hop trace and a re-verifiable
# chained, signed receipt.
#
# WHAT IT EXPOSES (all registered BEFORE the SPA catch-all via routes.insert(0)):
#   GET  /mcp/                          — MCP discovery card (canonical live MCP)
#   POST /mcp/                          — MCP JSON-RPC (initialize, tools/list, tools/call)
#   GET  /api/<ns>/v1/agent/tools       — plain tool catalog (mirror of MCP tools/list)
#   POST /api/<ns>/v1/agent/run         — the GOVERNED AGENT RUN (the whole loop)
#   POST /api/<ns>/v1/agent/verify-chain— re-verify a run's chained receipt
#   GET  /ask-and-act                   — the consumer/investor UI (one button)
#
# HONESTY DOCTRINE (never violated here):
#   - The RAG hop retrieves over a REAL in-image governance corpus (no external
#     FAISS dep; always present). Honestly labelled "in-image corpus".
#   - The trust score is the Λ advisory aggregator = Conjecture 1. Plain-language
#     "Trust score (advisory)". NEVER claimed proven-unique.
#   - The receipt is signed via the HOST APP's real signer (sign_fn). a11oy =
#     in-image ephemeral ECDSA-P256 (resets on rebuild, verifiable vs /cosign.pub);
#     killinchu = persistent cosign ECDSA-P256. Whichever is true is reported.
#   - DENY path emits NO action — only a deny receipt. Allow path emits the action.
#   - No amaru/sentra/rosie/Λ/Khipu/DSSE jargon shown to the user. Plain language.
