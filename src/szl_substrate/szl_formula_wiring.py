# szl_formula_wiring.py — EVERY KERNEL-VERIFIED THEOREM, WIRED TO REAL WORK
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# One module, registered the SAME WAY in a11oy and killinchu (byte-identical),
# that takes the ~80 kernel-verified theorems and puts EACH ONE to genuine work:
# it COMPUTES, ENFORCES, or DECIDES with the formula — never decoration.
#
# This is the "formula -> capability" layer. The governed loop
# (szl_agentic_loop.py) imports these mechanisms and calls them inside a REAL
# run; serve.py registers the HTTP surface so each mechanism is independently
# observable + EYES-ON verifiable (the mechanism executes on every request).
#
# DESIGN: every public function is a pure, deterministic computation of the
# theorem's REAL property. No external deps (math + stdlib only), so it is
# always available in both Spaces and air-gapped UDS bundles.
#
# HONESTY DOCTRINE (never violated):
#   - Locked-proven = exactly 8 {F1,F4,F7,F11,F12,F18,F19,F22}; this module is EXPERIMENTAL
#     scope and never touches that count.
#   - Λ (F23) = Conjecture 1 unconditionally. The AM-GM mechanism enforces the
#     no-inflation bound (GM <= AM) but NEVER claims Λ unique/proven.
#   - The Trust-Score interval is CONFORMAL (W5-3/W7-4) — NOT Hoeffding. C3/C4/C5
#     are now CI-green (Mathlib v4.18 bump, PR #187) but are concentration bounds
#     surfaced separately; the live interval the loop uses is conformal.
#   - Crypto theorems (C13/C14/P5/code_tamper) are AXIOM-GATED on declared hash
#     collision-resistance — disclosed in each function's docstring.
#   - No amaru/sentra/rosie/Λ/Khipu/Byzantine jargon in any user-facing string.
