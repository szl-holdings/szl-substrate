# QHAWAQ — Quechua: "the watcher / guardian / the one who sees".
# Lineage: Yachay (knowing) · Chaski (relay) · Khipu (record) · Ayni (reciprocity) ·
#          Ñawi (the eye that sees) · WILLAY (the one that discloses). QHAWAQ is the
#          one that WATCHES every proposed action BEFORE it reaches an effector.
#
# ===========================================================================
# QHAWAQ = a runtime CONSTITUTIONAL INTERCEPT (Glass Box-style), the FORMAL/LTL
# governance ring of the SZL estate. It sits between agent policy and effectors.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# PROVENANCE (honest, not invented):
#   The runtime-constitutional-intercept ARCHITECTURE is ADOPTED from the open
#   paper *Glass Box at Orbit: A Constitutional AI Verification Framework for
#   Trustworthy Autonomous CubeSat Intelligence* (arXiv:2606.02967, CC BY). That
#   paper intercepts each candidate action from an onboard policy and checks it
#   against physics-grounded constitutional constraints + LTL safety invariants
#   (verified there by Z3 + NuSMV) before any command reaches an actuator. We
#   RE-IMPLEMENTED the idea on OUR stack for the counter-UAS / governed-agent
#   domain — we did NOT copy its spacecraft constraints or its solver harness.
#
# WHERE QHAWAQ SITS IN THE LAYERED GOVERNANCE (honest separation of concerns):
#   • Restraint gate  (szl_restraint)        — the BUDGET / frugality ring.
#   • WILLAY gateway  (szl_willay_gateway)    — the CLASSIFIER ring (inspectable
#                                               safety classifiers, signed verdict).
#   • QHAWAQ monitor  (this module)           — the FORMAL / LTL ring: each
#                                               proposed ACTION is checked against
#                                               formal temporal + predicate
#                                               invariants before any effector
#                                               command is permitted.
#   The three are COMPLEMENTARY, not redundant. QHAWAQ is the per-action formal
#   monitor that turns the static Lean Λ-invariant thesis (Conjecture 1) into
#   LIVE runtime enforcement — provable runtime restraint, not just a gate.
#
# Z3 vs PURE-PYTHON — HONEST STATUS (doctrine: never claim verification you are
# not doing):
#   • The ACTIVE backend in this image is a clean, deterministic, pure-Python LTL
#     + predicate evaluator (no external solver dependency). It is what actually
#     runs and what produces every verdict on the served Spaces.
#   • A Z3 backend is detected at runtime IF the `z3-solver` package happens to be
#     importable, and is used ONLY to CROSS-CHECK (corroborate) the pure-Python
#     verdict — it never replaces it and is never required. On the HF cpu-basic
#     image z3-solver is NOT installed (not in requirements), so the Z3 backend is
#     reported as ROADMAP / not-active. We NEVER report "Z3 verified" unless the
#     Z3 backend was actually imported and actually ran on the action.
#   • The pure-Python evaluator is a sound, total evaluator over a bounded finite
#     trace (the proposed action + its declared context). It is NOT a general
#     model checker over unbounded traces — that unbounded SMT/model-checking
#     capability is the ROADMAP Z3/NuSMV item. We are explicit about this ceiling.
#
# DOCTRINE HARD GATES (this module never violates):
#   • locked theorems = EXACTLY 8 {F1,F4,F7,F11,F12,F18,F19,F22} @ kernel c7c0ba17.
#   • Λ = Conjecture 1 (NOT a closed theorem). Khipu = Conjecture 2.
#   • SLSA L1 honest / L2 roadmap / L3 roadmap.
#   • No user-visible legacy codenames (see doctrine sanitization table). 0 runtime CDN.
#   • Effectors are SIMULATED, human-on-loop — QHAWAQ ENFORCES this (it BLOCKS any
#     action that would drive a real vessel/weapon, and REQUIRES a human-on-loop
#     confirmation token before any simulated effector command).
#   • Trust is NEVER 100%: the monitor is TAMPER-EVIDENT and FALLIBLE by design.
#     It is honest about what it can and cannot prove. The receipt is signed, not
#     a guarantee of perfection.
#   • Never commit a key. Never weaken a gate. Data is labelled.

#
# Fields (all optional; missing => treated as the SAFE/restrictive default):

#   effector             : str   — target effector id (presence => effector cmd).
#   effector_real        : bool  — caller asserts this targets a REAL vessel/
#                                   weapon. QHAWAQ HARD-BLOCKS this (doctrine).
#   human_on_loop_token  : str   — a human-on-loop confirmation token. Absent on an
#                                   effector command => REQUIRE-HUMAN-CONFIRM.
#   state_changing       : bool  — does this mutate state / emit a command?
#   receipt_signed       : bool  — has a signed receipt been emitted BEFORE acting?
#   restraint            : dict  — {"budget": float, "spent": float} budget view.

# PURE-PYTHON LTL / PREDICATE EVALUATOR.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# We evaluate a small fragment of Linear Temporal Logic over a BOUNDED trace.
# For a single intercepted action the trace is one step (the proposed action +
# its declared context). The LTL operators we support over that bounded trace:
#   G phi   (Globally / always)   — phi must hold at every step of the trace.
#   X phi   (Next)                — phi must hold at the next step (here: the
#                                    post-action state implied by the action).
#   phi -> psi (implication)      — propositional implication at a step.
# An invariant is expressed as `G(precondition -> obligation)` — the canonical
# safety-invariant shape ("it is ALWAYS the case that IF the action is X THEN it
# must satisfy Y"). Each invariant carries a deterministic Python predicate over
# the normalized action; the evaluator records the LTL form, the predicate result,
# and (on violation) a human-readable proof-trace. This is SOUND and TOTAL over
# the bounded single-step trace. It is NOT a general unbounded model checker —
# that is the Z3/NuSMV ROADMAP item, and we say so.

  QHAWAQ is <b>tamper-evident and fallible by design</b> — it never claims a perfect/complete monitor
  (trust &lt; 100%). The active backend is a sound, total pure-Python LTL/predicate evaluator over a
  bounded single-step trace; an unbounded SMT/model-checking Z3/NuSMV backend is the documented
  ROADMAP item, and "Z3 ran" is only ever reported when z3-solver actually ran. Effectors are
  SIMULATED, human-on-loop only — QHAWAQ <b>enforces</b> this and blocks any real-effector command.
