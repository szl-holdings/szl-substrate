# ===========================================================================
# szl_uds_portability — the JUDGE-FACING UDS PORTABILITY + DEATH-PROOF surface.
# Served at /uds-portability on BOTH a11oy and killinchu (byte-identical module).
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# WHY THIS EXISTS (Warhacker rubric, PORTABILITY 25% + DEATH PROOF 25%):
#   Make the UDS / air-gap / "single tower, one command, no internet" story
#   VISUALLY UNDENIABLE during the founder demo. This surface SHOWS:
#     1. the 3 named payloads (a11oy.uds, killinchu.uds, energy.uds) as cards
#        — bundle name, version, size note, image digests, cosign-signed status,
#        and the ONE `uds deploy oci://…` command for each;
#     2. the AIR-GAP story — "no internet required, single tower" — with the
#        actual cable-pulled deploy command and the offline install flow
#        (Zarf packages → uds-core / k3d → Pepr policy → signed receipts);
#     3. a "verify offline" affordance — the exact cosign verify-blob +
#        receipt-verify commands anyone can copy-run;
#     4. the DEATH-PROOF visual — an HONEST SLSA L1/L2/L3-roadmap badge,
#        upgrade/rollback note, and a tamper-EVIDENT receipt demo.
#
# HONESTY CONTRACT (Doctrine v11, Zero-Bandaid Law) — this surface NEVER fakes:
#   • Image digests are the GHCR ground-truth resolved at AUTHORING time
#     (2026-06-15, anonymous manifest HEAD, all HTTP 200). They are labelled
#     PINNED-VERIFIED with the resolution date. The /uds/portability/live
#     endpoint RE-RESOLVES them against GHCR at request time WHEN the Space has
#     egress, and labels each row LIVE-MATCH / LIVE-DRIFT / UNREACHABLE — never
#     fabricating a status. If GHCR is unreachable (air-gapped Space) the card
#     falls back to the PINNED-VERIFIED value, honestly labelled CACHED-PIN.
#   • cosign-signed status: szl-mesh:v0.4.0 carries keyless cosign signatures
#     (verified in the AIRGAP runbook) → SIGNED. The per-app *-bundle:0.5.0
#     artifacts are PUBLISHED on GHCR; their signature is founder-gated
#     (FA-001 org key) → labelled BUNDLE-SIG ROADMAP, never claimed signed.
#   • energy.uds: the energy-harvest IMAGE is NOT yet published on GHCR →
#     labelled ROADMAP (build-valid Zarf package, image not yet pushed). We do
#     NOT claim it deploys today.
#   • SLSA is L1 honest / L2 attested (organ images: slsa.dev/provenance/v0.2,
#     cosign-verifiable) / L3 ROADMAP. NEVER bare L3, never FedRAMP/IronBank/
#     CMMC/ATO.
#   • Effectors are SIMULATED. Trust is NEVER 100%. Tamper-EVIDENT (not -proof).
#   • locked theorems = EXACTLY 8 {F1,F4,F7,F11,F12,F18,F19,F22} @ kernel
#     c7c0ba17. Λ = Conjecture 1. Khipu = Conjecture 2.
#   • 0 runtime CDN — every byte of CSS/JS is inline-vendored. No <script src>.
#   • NO user-visible internal codenames. NEVER commit a key (only the PUBLIC
#     cosign key fingerprint is shown).
#
# Mount/registration for a11oy + killinchu is via register(app, ns); the served
# tab HTML + API routes live at the bottom of this module (register()), and are
# FRONT-INSERTED before any SPA catch-all (learned from the WAQAY/Yupay 404).
