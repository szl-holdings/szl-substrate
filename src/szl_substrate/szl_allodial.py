"""szl_allodial.py — SZL Holdings "Allodial AI" sovereignty formula set.

EXPERIMENTAL-tier. PROPOSED engineering gate — adds NOTHING to the locked-8.
Λ stays Conjecture 1. Trust never 100%. No fabricated data. 0 runtime CDN.

Allodial title = ownership held ABSOLUTELY with no superior overlord (opposite of
feudal tenure). The digital analogue: an operator holds the governed-AI substrate
(model + weights + data) outright, on-prem / air-gap-capable, with a verifiable
provenance "chain of title" — no commercial overlord. Honest limit: like allodial
land, never literally absolute (lawful authority still applies).

Every formula below is DERIVED FROM PUBLISHED PRIOR ART and cites its real author;
SZL claims NONE as its own discovery. SZL's only contribution is the specific
AI-relevant dimension choice + the composition.
