szl_contracting.py — Contracting Readiness layer (a11oy + killinchu)
====================================================================

A SAM.gov / CAGE + SBIR/STTR contracting-readiness snapshot, surfaced with the
SAME honest live / cached / unreachable discipline as ``szl_readiness.py`` and
``szl_evidence_research.py``. Where the readiness layer grounds the *running
system* in real signals, this layer grounds the org's *federal-contracting
posture* in real, web-sourced eligibility criteria — and is scrupulously honest
about the difference between:

  * a **verified** external rule (the actual SAM.gov / SBIR eligibility
    requirement, each carrying a real source URL + retrieval date);
  * an org fact the system genuinely cannot see, flagged
    **needs_founder_input** (e.g. the org's actual UEI, CAGE code, employee
    count, ownership split) — a flagged unknown is the correct answer, never a
    fabricated number;
  * a real-world step only the founder can take, flagged
    **needs_founder_action** (e.g. complete a SAM.gov registration);
  * an org fact the operator has explicitly supplied through a secure
    environment variable, surfaced as **confirmed** (operator-confirmed, clearly
    distinguished from a web-verified rule — only appears when actually set).

Doctrine: nothing here is invented. Every *requirement* is read from an
authoritative source (sam.gov, sbir.gov, the eCFR, the DoD DSIP) and carries
that source URL + the date it was retrieved; every source URL is additionally
probed live for reachability (HEAD->GET, cached, honest live/cached/unreachable)
so the panel proves its citations resolve. NO registration number, expiration
date, or eligibility verdict about the org is ever asserted without either a
real external source or an explicit operator-supplied value — unknowns are
flagged, not filled.

Pattern mirrors szl_readiness.py:
    from szl_contracting import register as register_contracting
    register_contracting(app, ns="a11oy")

Endpoints (per namespace ns):
    GET /api/{ns}/v1/contracting
        -> full snapshot: every area, every item with its honest status,
           cited sources (with live reachability), summary, founder-action list
    GET /api/{ns}/v1/contracting/{area_id}/live
        -> force-fresh re-read of one area (entity|sbir|sttr|registration|timeline)
           with fresh source-reachability probes
    GET /api/{ns}/v1/contracting/sources/live
        -> focused live reachability sweep over every cited source URL
    GET /api/{ns}/v1/contracting/refresh
        -> light freshness sweep / one-line honest summary
