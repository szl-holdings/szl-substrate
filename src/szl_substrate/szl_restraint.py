szl_restraint.py — a11oy Restraint: a GOVERNED + MEASURED frugality gate for the
a11oy Code agent path.

PROVENANCE (honest, not invented):
    The 6-rung "ladder" reasoning and the intensity levels (lite/full/ultra) are
    ADOPTED from the open-source **Ponytail** coding-agent skill
    (github.com/DietrichGebert/ponytail, MIT, © 2026 DietrichGebert). We studied
    Ponytail's SKILL.md and benchmark methodology and RE-IMPLEMENTED the idea on
    our own stack — we did NOT bulk-copy its files. a11oy Restraint is Ponytail
    *governed* (every restraint decision becomes a signed DSSE receipt + Λ-scored)
    and *measured* (we reproduce the code-reduction / cost / speed numbers on OUR
    stack rather than repeating Ponytail's). Ponytail's published numbers
    (80-94% less code, 47-77% cheaper, 3-6x faster, median across Haiku/Sonnet/
    Opus) are CITED as Ponytail's, never claimed as ours.

WHAT THIS MODULE DOES (all real, deterministic):
    1. A pre-write reasoning gate the code agent applies before emitting a diff.
       It descends the 6-rung ladder and stops at the first rung that holds:
         (1) YAGNI — does this need to exist at all?
         (2) stdlib does it?
         (3) native platform feature?
         (4) already-installed dependency?
         (5) one line?
         (6) only then: minimum viable code.
       Intensity lite/full/ultra changes how aggressively rungs 1/5/6 fire.
    2. Emits `restraint:` ceiling comments (our honest rename of Ponytail's
       `ponytail:`) naming the upgrade path for each deliberate simplification.
    3. GOVERNED: every decision -> a signed DSSE receipt (caller passes the host's
       REAL in-image ECDSA-P256 signer _a11oy_sign_receipt) + a Λ trust score
       (Conjecture 1 is OPEN, advisory floor < 1.0; we never call it proven).
    4. MEASURED: a promptfoo-style benchmark harness with two arms — no-skill
       baseline vs a11oy-restraint — over Ponytail's five everyday tasks. Numbers
       are labelled MEASURED only when an actual run is wired; otherwise SAMPLE /
       ROADMAP. We never reprint Ponytail's numbers as ours.
    5. ENERGY: less code -> fewer tokens -> fewer joules on our GPU. A small,
       honestly-labelled tie-in estimates tokens/joules saved per decision and
       defers the joules honesty label to szl_joules_truth (SAMPLE unless a fresh
       on-box NVML exporter sample is present).

ENDPOINTS (routes insert at position 0 to beat the SPA catch-all):
    POST /api/a11oy/v1/restraint/evaluate  {task[, intensity, lang]} -> ladder
         decision + restraint: ceilings + lines-saved estimate + signed receipt
         + Λ score + energy tie-in.
    POST /api/a11oy/v1/restraint/bench     {[intensity]} -> two-arm benchmark
         (baseline vs a11oy-restraint) over the five tasks, honestly labelled.
    GET  /api/a11oy/v1/restraint/info      -> doctrine + ladder spec + Ponytail
         citation + honesty card.

ADDITIVE, self-contained, try/except-guarded by serve.py. Touches nothing else.
