a11oy Code — a GOVERNED agentic coder + chatbot, baked into a11oy.

WHAT THIS IS (honest, one line): a chat + coder + research surface where EVERY
turn flows through the *proven* P1-P6 governed loop (szl_agentic_loop) and emits
a signed, hash-chained, re-verifiable receipt. The differentiator is PROVEN
GOVERNANCE — not raw model power.

THREE GOVERNED MODES, all P1-P6, all receipted:
  1. CHAT     — multi-turn conversation.  govern -> answer -> signed receipt.
  2. CODE     — generate code AND run it in a REAL governed sandbox
                (plan -> policy/kernel gate -> isolated subprocess exec -> signed
                receipt of the run, with stdout/result).
  3. RESEARCH — retrieve + answer over REAL sources (the in-image RAG governance
                corpus + the app's already-wired live public feeds — CVE/KEV/MITRE/
                USGS) with citations.  govern -> cited answer -> signed receipt.

BUILT ON TOP OF (not parallel to) what already lives in a11oy:
  - szl_agentic_loop.py   -> the PROVEN 6-receipt P1-P6 loop. We import its
                             _retrieve / _trust_score / _sha primitives and build
                             the SAME chain semantics so receipts are byte-
                             compatible with the existing /agent/verify-chain.
  - szl_llm_registry.py   -> if present (forge squad's unified OPEN-WEIGHT roster)
                             we DEFER to it for the model roster. If absent we fall
                             back to our own honest open-weight roster below.
                             DeepSeek-Coder is a core model (forge owns the roster).
  - knowledge.json        -> proven-formula maturity (proven | axiom-gated |
                             CI-green | conjectured) surfaced as honest chips.
  - the host app's REAL signer (sign_fn) -> a11oy in-image ECDSA-P256 / killinchu
                             persistent cosign key. Receipts are genuinely signed.

HONESTY / LEGAL DOCTRINE (absolute):
  - OPEN-WEIGHT models only (Mistral/Nemo, Llama, Qwen2.5-Coder, DeepSeek-Coder,
    Codestral, StarCoder2, Gemma, Phi) per their commercial-OK licenses. NO closed
    weights claimed as baked in (GPT/Claude/Gemini are API-only — never claimed).
  - NO API KEY REQUIRED (offline-first). The local backend is a DETERMINISTIC,
    retrieval-grounded responder — it NEVER fakes generative model output. If a
    real local model is plugged in (LOCAL_MODEL_CMD env / tower GPU) it is used and
    honestly labeled; an optional HF router is used ONLY if a token is present, and
    its use is disclosed. With no model and no token, the backend returns honest,
    grounded, deterministic output labeled "local deterministic backend".
  - Patterns reimplemented as OUR OWN code (study of OpenHands/SWE-agent/Aider/
    Cline patterns — patterns are free; no GPL/AGPL/proprietary source copied).
  - NO "AGI" claims. "A governed agentic coder you can mathematically trust."
    Lambda (trust score) = Conjecture 1, advisory, never the gate. Locked proven=8 {F1,F4,F7,F11,F12,F18,F19,F22}.

FORMULA WIRING (the moat — cited in code, plain-language to the user):
  - C20  Softmax 1/2-Lipschitz (order/argmax-stable core)  -> model ROUTER stability.
         Bounded sensitivity => small input perturbations don't flip the routed model.
         (lutar-lean C20; PROVEN fragment.)
  - W7-5 PAC-Bayes min<=avg<=max routing envelope           -> ROUTER cost/risk bracket.
         A routed set's aggregate is provably bracketed by its component extremes.
         (lutar-lean wave-7 W7-5a/b/W7-5; PR #190, CI-green MD.)
  - W5-3 / W7-4 conformal coverage + rank-count/p-value     -> calibrated CONFIDENCE
         on a suggestion. Distribution-free interval; anti-overconfidence p>=1/(n+1)
         floor => we NEVER report 100% certainty. (wave-5/7; PROVEN, axiom-free.)
  - P1-P6 governed loop (Pipeline.lean, PR #188)            -> the governed RUN.
         P3 non-interference (Goguen-Meseguer 1982): untrusted/pasted input is
         quarantined and provably cannot flip a denied action. (axiom-free core.)
  - C10/C11/C12 Byzantine / DLS / FLP                        -> optional CONSENSUS
         vote across >=2 models (n>=3f+1 safety bound; FLP liveness caveat). PROVEN.
  - F-G5 bounded-frontier receipt-DAG termination            -> the agent loop
         provably HALTS (good for edge). (wave-6; PROVEN.)
