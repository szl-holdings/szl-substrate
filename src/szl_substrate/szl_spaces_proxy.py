"""szl_spaces_proxy.py — surface the live HF Spaces estate under a-11-oy.com/spaces/*.

ADDITIVE, self-contained, SHARED (byte-identical in a11oy + killinchu). Founder rule:
"all the huggingface on my a-11-oy.com" with NO new subdomains. This module reverse-
proxies each live Hugging Face Space to a same-origin path:

    GET/HEAD /spaces                 -> index (delegates to szl_spaces_surface tiles if
                                        present; else a minimal honest index of the 11)
    GET/HEAD /spaces/{name}          -> reverse-proxy of https://szlholdings-{name}.hf.space/
    GET/HEAD /spaces/{name}/{path}   -> reverse-proxy of that Space's sub-paths/assets

The proxy is a SERVER-SIDE fetch over the app's shared httpx.AsyncClient (resolved
lazily from serve.py's module global, like szl_engine_status), NOT a browser CDN load —
so it satisfies the 0-runtime-CDN doctrine for the same reason a11oy_hf_assets.py states
(server-side fetch, not a browser CDN). HTML responses get a <base href="/spaces/{name}/">
injected so the Space's root-relative assets resolve back through this proxy.

HONEST DEGRADE: upstream timeout / connect error / unreachable -> a clean 502 page
("Space <name> is starting / unreachable — open directly: <hf.space url>"). NEVER a fake
200. Hop-by-hop headers are stripped. The proxy is an ALLOWLIST of the known Space names
only (no open proxy); unknown names -> 404. a11oy is NOT self-proxied (would loop) and
killinchu is served on its own host — both are listed as TILES (by szl_spaces_surface)
linking to their canonical hosts, but are NOT in the reverse-proxy allowlist here.

No auth token is forwarded to HF — these are PUBLIC Spaces.

Routes are inserted at the FRONT of app.router.routes (app.router.routes[0:0] = new)
so they win over the /api/<ns>/{path:path} Node proxy + the /{full_path:path} SPA
catch-all (the same route-to-front idiom a11oy_hf_assets.py uses).

Doctrine v11: locked-proven = EXACTLY 8 {F1,F4,F7,F11,F12,F18,F19,F22} @ c7c0ba17;
Λ = Conjecture 1; Khipu = Conjecture 2; trust never 100%; 0 runtime CDN (server-side
fetch); no user-visible codenames (Space names are their own honest titles); never
commits a key; additive-only; never weakens a gate; honest 502 beats a fake 200.
